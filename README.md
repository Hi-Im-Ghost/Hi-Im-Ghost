### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate of Computer Science at Kielce University of Technology with a Master's degree in Computer Graphics. My thesis on machine learning in the Unity environment, which I defended, was graded 5 and awarded a distinction. In addition to this, I have done multiple projects in various technologies, with a special focus on Unity, Unreal Engine, artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am ambitious, enjoy teamwork and am constantly developing my skills. I am currently focusing on game development, exploring Unity and Unreal Engine.
