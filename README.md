### Hello World ?
I am a 5th year student of Computer Science at Kielce University of Technology, holding an engineering degree in the same field. I have done numerous projects in various technologies, with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am ambitious, enjoy teamwork and am constantly expanding my skills. I am currently focused on Game Development, exploring Unity and Unreal Engine. I am also writing my Master's thesis on machine learning in the Unity environment, while looking for career opportunities in IT.
